# Finetune Tutorial

This repository contains tutorial materials based on the DeepLearning.AI course 'Finetuning Large Language Models'. This tutorial aims to help learners grasp the fundamental concepts and practical skills of fine-tuning large language models (LLM).

## Course Overview

This tutorial is based on the [Finetuning Large Language Models](https://www.coursera.org/projects/finetuning-large-language-models-project) project course on Coursera. The course is taught by Sharon Zhou and aims to introduce the core concepts and practical methods of LLM fine-tuning in a short period.

### Learning Objectives

Through this tutorial, you will be able to:

- Understand when to apply LLM fine-tuning
- Prepare data for fine-tuning
- Train and evaluate LLMs on your own data

## Prerequisites

This tutorial is suitable for intermediate learners. You should have:

- Basic Python programming skills
- A basic understanding of deep learning frameworks (like PyTorch)

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the following:

The `code` folder contains Jupyter notebooks that guide you through the fine-tuning process:

1. `01_Why_finetuning_lab_student.ipynb`: Introduction to the concept of fine-tunin
2. `02_Where_finetuning_fits_in_lab_student.ipynb`: Understanding the role of fine-tuning in LLM development
3. `03_Instruction_tuning_lab_student.ipynb`: Exploring instruction tuning techniques
4. `04_Data_preparation_lab_student.ipynb`: Guide on preparing data for fine-tuning
5. `05_Training_lab_student.ipynb`: Walkthrough of the training process
6. `06_Evaluation_lab_student.ipynb`: Methods for evaluating fine-tuned models

Additionally, there are two JSON files:

* `alpaca_processed.jsonl`: Processed dataset for fine-tuning
* `lamini_docs_processed.jsonl`: Another processed dataset for fine-tuning

The `figure` folder contains various images that supplement the tutorial

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Read the tutorial documents in order.
3. Run the provided code examples.
4. Try fine-tuning experiments with your own datasets.
